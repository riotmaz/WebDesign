    <h1>Full Stack development</h1>
    <p>Full stack development involves working on both the front end (client side) and back end (server side) of a web application,
       covering everything a user sees and interacts with, as well as the underlying functionality and data management.

        - Front end: Uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frameworks (like React or Angular) to build the user interface and experience.<br>
        - Back end: Involves server-side languages and frameworks (like Node.js, Django, or Ruby on Rails) to handle databases, 
                    authentication, APIs, and server logic.<br>
        - Databases: Works with databases like MySQL, MongoDB, or PostgreSQL to store and manage data.<br>
        
        A full stack developer is skilled in both areas, enabling them to build an entire application from start to finish.</p>
    
    <h2>Front End</h2>    
    <p>The front end is the part of a website or app that users interact with directly. It includes:

        - HTML for structure<br>
        - CSS for styling<br>
        - JavaScript for interactivity<br>
        
        Front-end developers use frameworks like React, Vue.js, and Angular to build responsive, visually appealing, and functional 
        user experiences. They ensure the site looks good on all devices and handle visual elements, layouts, and user interactions.      
        The front end is also known as the client side and differs from the back end, which manages data and server operations behind 
        the scenes.</p>
    <h3>Back End Development</h3>
    <p>The back end is the server side of a web application that handles data storage, processing, and management, ensuring the front 
        end works smoothly. It’s responsible for:

        - Server: Manages requests and hosts the application.<br>
        - Database: Stores, retrieves, and updates data (e.g., using MySQL, MongoDB).<br>
        - Application Logic: Processes requests, applies business rules, and manages data flow.<br>
        
        Back-end developers use languages like Python, Java, Node.js, and frameworks like Django and Express. They ensure data security, 
        server functionality, and overall application performance. Unlike the front end, users don’t directly see the back end, but it 
        powers everything users interact with.</p>
